#5 Different ways to read a file line by line in Python
-------------------------------------------------------
#Open file    
fileHandler = open ("data.txt", "r")
# Get list of all lines in file
listOfLines = fileHandler.readlines()
# Close file
fileHandler.close()

# Iterate over the lines, strip() is used to remove the empty lines inbetween the lines
for line in listOfLines:
    print(line.strip())
   
#But if file size is large then it will consume a lot of memory, so better avoid this solution in case of large files

#Read a file line by line using readline()

# Open file        
fileHandler = open ("data.txt", "r")
while True:
    # Get next line from file
    line = fileHandler.readline()
    # If line is empty then end of file reached
    if not line :
        break;
    print(line.strip())
# Close Close    
fileHandler.close()


# Open file
with open ("data.txt", "r") as fileHandler:
    # Read each line in loop
    for line in fileHandler:
        # As each line (except last one) will contain new line character, so strip that
        print(line.strip())
       
# open a file
file_object = open('sample.txt')
# read the file content
data = file_object.read()
# print file content
print(data)
#close the file
file_object.close()

#we don’t call the close() function, then its object will be consuming the memory of our process. Also, there might be chances that data will not entirely be flushed to the file.


# File is not closed in case of exception
try:
    # open a file
    file_object = open('sample.txt')
    # read file content
    data = file_object.read()
    # It will raise an exception
    x = 1 / 0

    # Handling the exception
    print('An Error')
